            With over 35 years of experience in Social Services, Cynthia has
            dedicated her life to helping others thrive. From Case Manager to
            Director of Programs, her journey has always been driven by a desire
            to uplift individuals and families, guiding them toward brighter
            futures. Cynthia's passion for service is rooted in her own
            story—one marked by resilience and a commitment to making a positive
            impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Cynthia moved to New York City,
            where she grew up in public housing. Looking up at the towering
            buildings around her, she often wondered, "What does life have to
            offer on the other side of that rainbow?" That curiosity fueled her
            lifelong commitment to helping others realize their potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now semi-retired and living in Jacksonville, Florida, Cynthia
            channels her passion and experience into her Certified Life Coaching
            practice. Her mission is to provide personalized coaching services
            that support individuals in regaining and bolstering their
            confidence in life, work, skills, and education—enabling them to
            successfully pursue their goals. She specializes in personal
            development and overcoming obstacles, working primarily with young
            adults, women and families, and millennials navigating career
            decisions.

          <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            Cynthia credits her success to the unwavering support of her kind
            and loving family, which enabled her to earn two college degrees and
            build a thriving career in Social Services. With more than 35 years
            of experience, Cynthia has demonstrated a remarkable ability to
            lead, organize, and mobilize individuals and teams to make a
            meaningful impact on communities and individuals alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early in her career, Cynthia held leadership roles within the
            American Red Cross, including Director of Emerging Services and
            Assistant Manager with the International Division. During this time,
            she supervised over 6,000 service members and managed 50 to 60
            volunteers, showcasing her strength in leadership and community
            organization. Upon returning to the U.S., she continued her
            impactful work by leading programs that supported military
            installations and families.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her professional journey then expanded to roles that directly
            addressed community needs and social challenges. As a Family Service
            Counselor and Supervisor, Court Liaison, Medical Disability
            Examiner, and Public Assistance Worker, Cynthia worked on the front
            lines of support for individuals and families facing hardship. She
            established policies, directed programs, and collaborated with
            schools, social services, hospitals, and community panels to deliver
            essential services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cynthia's expertise spans a wide range of areas, including foster
            care services, prison reentry programs, developmental disability
            services, public assistance, and child support advocacy. Whether
            helping individuals adapt back into the community after
            incarceration or guiding families through the complexities of social
            services, Cynthia has consistently demonstrated her commitment to
            empowering others with the tools and resources they need to succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of her greatest strengths lies in her ability to connect,
            communicate, and mobilize. From recruiting, hiring, and training
            professionals to developing community partnerships, she has
            continuously shown a talent for transforming challenges into
            opportunities. These skills directly inform her work as a Life
            Coach, where she leverages her vast experience to help clients
            regain confidence, develop practical life skills, and create
            attainable goals.

          <h3 class="major">Success Stories</h3>

          <div class="success-story">
            <h4>From Crisis to Triumph</h4>
            <p>
              Cynthia worked with a mother of six who faced legal challenges
              that put her children at risk of entering foster care. Through
              personalized coaching and goal setting, Cynthia empowered her to
              rebuild her life—starting from working as a fast-food cashier to
              ultimately becoming a manager. With Cynthia's support, she secured
              stable housing, completed an outpatient drug treatment program,
              had her court record sealed, and was reunited with her children.
              This remarkable transformation not only changed the mother's life
              but also gained local and national recognition for the client and
              the organization Cynthia represented.
            </p>

          <div class="success-story">
            <h4>An Academic Turnaround</h4>
            <p>
              During her time working in behavioral health services, Cynthia
              supported a high school senior whose mother was concerned about
              his mental health and academic performance. Facing the possibility
              of not graduating, he needed guidance and clear direction. Cynthia
              worked with him to identify his strengths—particularly in science
              and technology—and helped him set realistic, attainable goals.
              With her mentorship, his grades improved from C-level to A-level,
              he participated in college preparatory meetings, and ultimately
              graduated with a scholarship to attend vocational college.
